Seq CL3 and CL4 Notes


2)  Specification Comments:
At first glance, CL3 is a bit unclear in some areas.
I wasn't sure what limit arguments meant. Figured out they are the command line arguments of where the sequence should begin and end and a third new argument for how much to increment.
It was also unclear if CL3 was only pertaining to the one new flag or all of the program when it mentioned that the program should accept new number formats. I gathered only the new format-word flag should accept the additional formats.

3)  Testing:


4)  Pseudocode:


5)  Code:
Changed the int tests so they are used only by the flags that require ints.
Added the -F flag, used the choices option for the different number formats.
Added a z flag for the third optional increment argument.
Added implementation for arabic accepting long integers.
Added floating for floating point values.
Added alpha and ALPHA for letter sequences.
