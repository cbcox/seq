CL2 Notes


2)  Spec Questions/Comments:
Not sure what the note on "-w" means. I'm assuming it is referring to equal-width which already uses 0s to even out the length of the integers. Other than that, the spec seems pretty straight forward.

3)	Tests:

4)	Pseudocode:
	My pseudocode this time is more like code than english since some of the arguments are similar to ones from CL1. It is heavily commented, though.

5)	Code:
	For -p, pad, I wasn't sure if it meant that this function should do the same as equal width except with a selected char, or if there should be extra padding. 
	For example, if you had 1 - 20, 1-9 would get padded with one char on the left and the rest wouldn't get padded if you want equal width or they all get padded with the char on the left to be of a certain total length, ::1 - :20. 
	I chose to take the max string length in the array and add three padding chars to it, I think it looks better and more deliberate.
