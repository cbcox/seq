CL0 Notes
Purpose: to discuss thoughts and findings regarding CL0 in the seq command implementation


2)  From the CL0 spec, it looks like I will need two or three error checks. A check to ensure two arguments are accepted and both are of integer value and a check to make sure the integers are input in ascending order, which will probably be included in the if statement in the main part of this implementation. I don't currently have any concerns or questions but that may change once I get going. :)

3)  I can't work on redmine right now since I was unaware of having an mcecs account or needing to validate it. Hopefully I will get this resolved before 1:30pm on Monday. For now, I will just work with git.
