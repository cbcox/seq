2)Questions/Concerns:
	--seperator and --equalwidth seem pretty straight forward
	--format will be more challenging with the different flags
	I will probably be changing some of my previous code as well to run more smoothly with the new functionality

3)Tests:
I wrote some tests for different user input such as different seperator characters and checking if all the integers were of the same length for equalwidth.

4)Psuedocode: 
I'm still thinking in terms of C++, so I've been over thinking the solutions a lot. The actual code for this is probably going to be somewhat simpler than my pseudocode.

5)Code:
Python has a lot of great implementation. I was able to use the argsparse function to take the command line arguments. Python also had a lot of built in functions to convert integers to different forms which were very useful. 
I was afraid that a lot of my pseudocode wouldn't work well with python implementation but it actually was a huge help in writing the final project.
**Update** I added the floating point functionality which was missing for first turn in.
